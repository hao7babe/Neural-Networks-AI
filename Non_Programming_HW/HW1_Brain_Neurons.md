# HW to Chapter 1: Brain, Neurons, and Models

## 1. How does natural neuron work?
- Neuron transmits electrical signals through its axon and dendrite, and connects other neurons through its synapse.
- Each neuron can form thousands of synaptic connections, forming neural networks.

## 2. How does natural neuron transmit signal to other neurons?
- A neuron works by receiving enough signals (above a certain threshold) that it "fires" and passes the signal on to other neurons.

## 3. Describe the McCulloch and Pitts model of artificial neuron?
- The **McCulloch and Pitts model** is a simple representation of a neuron:
    1. It takes binary inputs (0 or 1).
    2. Each input has a weight that shows its importance.
    3. The inputs are added up.
    4. If the total is above a threshold, the neuron outputs 1 (fires); otherwise, it outputs 0.
- This model can do basic logic tasks (like AND, OR), but it canâ€™t handle complex problems or learn from experience.
