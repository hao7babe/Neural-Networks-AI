### What is convolution operation and how does it work?

Convolution is a mathematical operation used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from input data, typically images. It works by sliding a smaller matrix, called a **filter** or **kernel**, over the input matrix (image) and performing an element-wise multiplication followed by a sum. This process generates a single value for each position of the filter, producing a new matrix called the **feature map** or **convoluted image**.

For example, if the input image is a 2D matrix of pixel values, the filter captures specific patterns, such as edges or textures, by highlighting regions that match its values.

### Why do we need convolutional layers in neural networks?

Convolutional layers are essential in neural networks for processing structured data like images due to the following reasons:
1. **Feature Extraction**: They identify spatial hierarchies of patterns, such as edges, corners, and complex structures.
2. **Parameter Efficiency**: They significantly reduce the number of parameters compared to fully connected layers by reusing the same filter across the entire input.
3. **Translation Invariance**: They help detect features irrespective of their position in the input.
4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Convolution simplifies the input by focusing on meaningful features while reducing spatial dimensions.

### How are sizes of the original image, the filter, and the resultant convoluted image related?

The size of the resultant convoluted image depends on the sizes of the original image, the filter, and the stride. The formula is:
\[ O = \frac{I - F + 2P}{S} + 1 \]
Where:
- \( O \): Output size (height or width of the convoluted image)
- \( I \): Input size (height or width of the original image)
- \( F \): Filter size (height or width of the filter)
- \( P \): Padding size
- \( S \): Stride

### What is padding and why is it needed?

**Padding** is the process of adding extra layers (usually zeros) around the input matrix before applying convolution. It is needed for the following reasons:
1. **Preserve Dimensions**: Without padding, the output size decreases after each convolution. Padding maintains the input size.
2. **Edge Feature Detection**: Padding allows filters to interact with edge pixels of the input.
3. **Control Output Dimensions**: By adding padding, we can control the size of the output matrix.

### What is strided convolution and why is it needed?

**Strided convolution** involves moving the filter across the input matrix with a step size greater than one. This step size is called the **stride**. It is needed for:
1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Larger strides reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature map, lowering computational complexity.
2. **Efficient Computation**: It allows CNNs to process larger images more efficiently by reducing intermediate sizes.
3. **Feature Selection**: Larger strides focus on coarser features by skipping redundant information.

For example, with a stride of 2, the filter skips every alternate row and column, effectively halving the output dimensions compared to a stride of 1.
